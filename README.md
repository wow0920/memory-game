# A memory game

- we need to show 6 pairs of duplicated images
- shuffle the 12 images and show them as tiles(card)
- when we click each image, it should be flipped (only unflipped cards)
- after a second, if two selected images don't match, they should be flipped back.
- matched images will not be clicked any longer
